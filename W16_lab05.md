a) The states quiz is an implementation of a simple geography quiz game. The user must guess the location of a random US state or capital on a map.

b) As a student, I can quiz myself on states so that I can improve my knowledge of US Geography.
   As a teacher, I can have my students quiz themselves on capitals so they can study for an upcoming exam.
   
c) The software runs smoothly. The starting screen has buttons to select different game modes, and depending on the game mode the program prompts the user for a given state or capital. However, there are some very minor UI issues.

d) The readme gives a good comprehensive overview of how the game works and how the program's elements were designed. From a programming perspective, there is considerably more explanation of how the State and Country classes work than how the user interface works.

g) New issues:
  1) At game start, bottom button "state then capital" is cut off ("State then Cap..")
  2) In the "state then capital" mode, when a capital is incorrectly guessed, the user has to re-click the original state.     Instead, the game should simply re-prompt the user for the capital.
  3) The top of the JFrame says "you think you know US States?", but it could change to reflect the current game mode.
