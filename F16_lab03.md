## (a) Description
This is a quiz game in which you have to guess the states and capitals of the United States of America.

## (b) A Set of User Stories
As a player, I can guess the location of different states so I can earn points and get a high score.

As a confused player, I can ask for hints so I can make an educated guess.

As a player, I can change the difficulty settings so that i can play a game more suited to my skills.

As a user, I can guess the capitals so that I can also be proficient in that field.

## (c) A Brief Assessment of whether the software runs or not
The software does run indeed! The game starts with a main menu where you can pick the difficulty and the type of game you want to play (states mode or capital mode). In the capitals guessing mode, a window appears, prompting you to type in the capital of the state.

## (d) A Set of User Suggestions
As a user, I want to be able to give up trying to guess a capital so that I won't be stuck there.

As a user, I would like the easy mode to be a multiple choice option so that the mode will be easier.

## (e) Current Quality of the README.md
This README.md is extremely well put together, organized, clear, and aesthetically pleasing. However, the screenshots are outdated, so that is something we can touch up on.

## (f) build.xml State
This file has clear descriptions for each target.

## (g) Current Issues
The issues total up to around 700 points. They also seem simple and easy. The issues are clear in terms of what the expectations are.

## (h) Our Added Issues
[There should be a back button for users that are currently in game to take them back to the main menu.](https://www.google.com "Back Button Issue")
