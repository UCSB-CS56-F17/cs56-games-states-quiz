## (a) Description
This is a quiz game that tests your ability to recognize the U.S. states/capitals.

## (b) As a user, I can select a difficulty. As a user I can select a game mode. As a confused player, I can click on hints. As a normal player, I can click on states and capitals. As a player I can see my score and the time elapsed.

## (c) Yes it runs. The software can keep a score of the correct answers in the current game as well as the highest score in the main menu. It displays the correct answers you have answered correctly, the total amount of guesses, the wrong state you click on, and the time elapsed. It also displays a hint after 3 wrong guesses.

## (d) A better display that shows the user the correct answer has been selected (other than the list). Get rid of the "correct answers" box view while playing the game, and add a feature that allows the user to view it when they want (more emphasis on the map than the correct answer box). Better placement of the hint button. Add achievements documentation.

## (e) Current README.md is up to date according to the current software. Screenshots are the most current images and is clear to read.

## (f) The build.xml file is clear, descriptive and up to date.

## (g) Yes, there is 16 issues which is enough to earn 1000 points. Every single issue has a thorough description and the amount of points each one is worth, making it clear as to what the expectations are.

## (h) We did not run into any issues, however there are some features that could be added to enhance the playing experience. 

## (i) The classes are organized by feature making it easier to navigate.
AnswerOption.java - keeps track of the user's correct/incorrect/no answer by setting the message instance to the user's response.

Country.java - Creates the country object and adds the states to the country.

State.java - Creates State object and sets the captial of the state. Also keeps track of the coordinates of the state on the map. 

FrontPanel.java - Creates the menu screen that you see when you first run the program.

GameFrame.java - Creates the frame sizes of the actual game and creates an instance of the QuestionManager.

GamePanel.java - Creates the Correct Answer frame that keeps track of the list of correct answers from the user.

MapPanel.java - Displays the blank map and holds the information about each state. It implements the button feature that users can use to play.

QuestionManager.java - Keeps track of the current questions and score.

SoundManager.java - Provides methods to play different sound effects.

StopWatch.java - Creates a stopwatch and starts it. Adds 2 second penalty for wrong answers. 

Each method has a documentation comment which makes it easier to understand what each method does. If we had to convery information to someone else looking at the code, we would say that each class is split up by feature. 

## (j) This project does not have any test coverage and no JUnit tests. Since there are no tests, we can add tests which will expand the test coverage. To expand the test coverage, we could test if every game mode is working properly.
